Mobile app creation tool - Creating an app to find restaurants nearby

//////////////////////////////

There's only one app flow that works so far.  Here are the instructions:
1. Tap "Custom"
2. Name the app and hit Next
3. Select the Red Icon and hit Next.
4. The next few screens show the "ingredients" to the app. Just hit Next and leave everything pre-selected.
5. You can see the app you made, then hit Publish to create the app, and hit the link.

It's buggy right now, and only the Custom list item works.  The user can create a restaurant finder app, and then share it with friends, so they can find restaurants in their immediate vicinity.

This has only been testing on iPhone and iOS Simulator.

Design Goals:
- people want customized, personalized apps
- apps (vs a website) have dynamic content, that is personalized to the user
- the end product for these are contextual, local, one-off, adhoc, impromptu/throw-away apps
- the app creation can either guide by a template structure (guides for all the App Store categories eg. Games, Books, Business, etc.) or it's completely open-ended, possibly with 1 input and 1 output (similar to https://ifttt.com/wtf and http://www.atooma.com/welcome)
- I'm generally more aligned with philosophies similar to Bret Victor re: content creation for mobile, in that it should use mobile features/affordances to create rather than using QUERTY coding used for desktop
