Mobile app creation tool - Creating an app to find restaurants nearby

//////////////////////////////

It's buggy right now, and only the Custom list item works.  The user can create a restaurant finder app, and then share it with friends, so they can find restaurants in their immediate vicinity.

This has only been testing on iPhone and iOS Simulator.

Design Goals:
- people want customized, personalized apps
- apps (vs a website) have dynamic content, that is personalized to the user
- the end product for these are contextual, local, one-off, adhoc, impromptu/throw-away apps
- the app creation can either guide by a template structure (guides for all the App Store categories eg. Games, Books, Business, etc.) or it's completely open-ended, possibly with 1 input and 1 output (similar to https://ifttt.com/wtf and http://www.atooma.com/welcome)
- I'm generally more aligned with philosophies similar to Bret Victor re: content creation for mobile, in that it should use mobile features/affordances to create rather than using QUERTY coding used for desktop
